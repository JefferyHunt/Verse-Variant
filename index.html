<h4>1. Choose a Starting Scholar</h4>
<p>Randomly give the Start-Player Quill to one player; play proceeds clockwise.</p>
<h4>2. Prepare the Document Deck</h4>
<p><strong>a. Prepare the Tools</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Shuffle the 5 cards of rank T-1 face-down; draw one at random.</li>
<li>Repeat for ranks T-2 through T-15.</li>
<li>Return the unused Tools to the box without revealing them.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>b. Combine Cards</strong></p>
<p>Combine the 15 selected Tool cards with the 45 Witness cards; shuffle into a single 60-card deck.</p>
<h4>3. Deal Cards</h4>
<ul>
<li>3 players: 20 cards each</li>
<li>4 players: 15 cards each</li>
<li>5 players: 12 cards each</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Place Spotlight-Track Board</h4>
<p>Place the board near the Reading Desk. On each space of each track, beginning with the highest space, in a 3 player game, place alternating stacks of 1 and 2 of each track's assocaited Feature Token, in a 4 player game, stacks of 2, and in a 5 player game, alternating stacks of 2 and 3.</p>
<h4>5. Prepare the Institutions</h4>
<p>Arrange the five Institution Boards in any order. Place the Edition Laureate token next to the row.</p>

<div class="page-break"></div><div class="page">
<h2>Game Overview</h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Across a number of Collation Sessions equal to the number of scholars, you will gather manuscript fragments, apply scholarly tools, earn grants, and earn prestige by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building groups and majorities of Manuscript Features</li>
<li>Assembling complete Critical Sets (one of each Feature)</li>
<li>Obtaining Institution Grants for immediate rewards and end-game points</li>
<li>Conserving Grants and securing the Edition Laureate bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>The scholar with the highest Prestige total after final scoring is hailed <strong>Editor-in-Chief</strong> of the new critical edition.</p>
<h3>Session Structure</h3>
<p>A session consists of a sequence of Haggling Bouts, classic trick-taking rounds, until every scholar's hand is empty.</p>
<p>Each Bout follows this rhythm:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Play Witness &amp; Echo</strong>
<ul>
<li>All scholars play one open card to contest the bout.</li>
<li>If able, they simultaneously contribute a hidden echo card to the Reading Desk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resolve the Bout</strong>
<ul>
<li>Card hierarchy: Tools (trump) &gt; current Spotlight Scriptorium wins ties &amp; otherwise = lead color &gt; others; highest wins.</li>
<li>The player of the highest losing card gains a Eureka disc if they don't already have one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Archive to the Reading Desk</strong>
<ul>
<li>All primary and echo cards join the Reading Desk face up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Preservation Window</strong>
<ul>
<li>In finish order, scholars may spend a Grant to claim the entire Desk.</li>
<li>Passing hands the option downward‚Äîunless someone exercises an Archive-Lockdown to close the window instantly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Institution Check</strong>
<ul>
<li>A scholar who just claimed the Desk may fill one Institution slot by discarding 2 copies of its Feature from their evidence ledger.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lead Passes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lead passes to the bout winner; another bout begins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="rule-note">
<p><strong>Deck Flow Note:</strong> With echo play, each bout normally burns two cards per scholar. In a four-player game, the 15-card hand yields seven full echo bouts plus one final orphan bout without echoes.</p>
</div>
<h3>End of a Collation Session</h3>
<p>When all hands are empty and the last Preservation Window is resolved, any cards still on the Reading Desk are ignored. Proceed to Final Scoring to determine the winner.</p>
</div>
<!-- Page 4-5: Haggling Bout Procedure -->
<div class="page-break"></div><div class="page">
<h2>Haggling Bout Procedure</h2>
<h3>4.1 Play Primary &amp; Echo Cards</h3>
<p>Proceed clockwise from the scholar with the Start-Player Quill. On your turn, perform 2 or 3 steps in this exact order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>(Optional) Spend Eureka</strong>
<p>If you currently hold an unused Eureka disc, you may discard it to the supply. Doing so grants +2 virtual rank to the Primary card you are about to play (Tools included).</p>
<ul>
<li>You can never hold more than one Eureka, so you either spend it now or keep it for a later bout.</li>
<li>Once discarded, the bonus is locked in; you cannot retract it if other scholars subsequently boost their own ranks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Choose &amp; place your two cards</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary slot:</strong> Play one card face-up (Witness or Tool).</li>
<li><strong>Echo slot:</strong> Play one card face-down directly onto the Reading Desk (Witness or Tool). Echo cards never influence bout rank.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When every scholar has completed step 2, continue to 4.3 Determine Highest Cards.</p>
<h3>4.2 Tool Timing</h3>
<table class="table">
<tr>
<th>Where the Tool is played</th>
<th>What happens</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Primary slot</strong> (face-up)</td>
<td>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 16pt;">
<li>If the Tool's timing row includes "Instant," you must resolve the effect immediately and then add it to the Reading Desk.</li>
<li>If the Tool's printed timing is anything other than Instant, add it to the scholar's tableau and resolve it according to its printed rule. Add to Desk after triggering.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tool cards (trump)</strong> ‚Äî higher rank wins.</li>
<li><strong>Witnesses of the Lead Scriptorium and Witnesses of the Spotlight Scriptorium</strong> ‚Äî evaluate together:
                <ul>
<li>Compare ranks; the highest numeric value among these cards wins.</li>
<li>If two cards are tied for highest rank and one of them is Spotlight, the Spotlight card wins the tie.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cards of other colors</strong> can never outrank Lead or Spotlight cards (unless a Tool says otherwise).</li>
</ol>
<div class="rule-note">
<h4>How to evaluate Spotlight:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If exactly one color holds the highest demand value, it is Spotlight.</li>
<li>If two or more colors share that highest value, Spotlight passes to the unique color with the next-highest demand value; if all five colors are tied, Spotlight is off until the tie is broken.</li>
<li>You are still required to follow the Lead color with your Primary play if able; the Spotlight color does not create an additional follow obligation.</li>
<li>If the Spotlight and Lead colors are the same, simply treat it as the normal Lead color‚Äîno special tie rule applies because a tie cannot occur (only one card per rank in that color).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>4.4 Award Bout &amp; Eureka</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Winner</strong> ‚Äì highest Primary card; takes the Quill for next bout.</li>
<li><strong>Eureka</strong> ‚Äì highest losing Primary card gains a Eureka disc if they do not already hold one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.5 Reveal Echoes &amp; Move Cards to Desk</h3>
<p>Turn all face-down Echo cards face-up; they, together with all Primary cards, now are added to the Reading Desk.</p>
</div>
<div class="page-break"></div><div class="page">
<h3>4.6 Preservation Window</h3>
<p>In finish order‚Äîwinner, 2nd, 3rd‚Ä¶, each scholar must:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take:</strong> spend one unused Preservation-Grant to claim the entire Desk.</li>
<li><strong>Pass:</strong> do nothing. If all players pass (once around), the preservation window closes.</li>
<li><strong>Archive-Lockdown:</strong> Flip Archive-Lockdown tile to its used side; all remaining scholars in this window are skipped and the Desk stays. The Preservation Window closes. This may only be done once per scholar, per Collation Session.</li>
</ol>
<div class="setup-box">
<h4>Claiming a Reading Desk</h4>
<p>When you declare "Take" during the Preservation Window, carry out these eight numbered steps in order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spend a Preservation-Grant.</strong>
<p>Flip one of your unused Grant markers to its spent side.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Trigger any "when you claim a Desk" Tools.</strong>
<p>If you already had delayed Tools waiting for this moment, you may activate them now.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Sweep the Desk.</strong>
<p>Slide every card‚ÄîPrimary and Echo, Witness and Tool‚Äîinto your play area.</p>
<li><strong>Tokenise your haul.</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each Feature or Lacuna on a Witness card, take a Feature or Lacuna token into your Evidence Ledger. Take the Feature Tokens from the matching Spotlight Demand Track. If you uncover a bonus, recieve it now. If the Spotlight track is empty, take the Feature Token from the supply. If the supply is empty, use a suitable substitute. Take Lacuna Tokens from the supply.¬† ¬†</li>
<li>For each Corruption, discard two of the associated Feature Tokens from your Evidence Ledger.</li>
<li>Discard all Witness Cards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lacuna Exchange (optional).</strong>
<p>The Reading Desk may contain Tool cards. You may repeat the following sequence as often as you wish, limited by the number of Lacuna tokens in your Ledger and the number of Tools in this haul:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Discard two Lacuna tokens.</li>
<li>Place any one card from your hand face-up to your tableau; if it is a Witness, immediately tokenise it as in Step 4.</li>
<li>Choose one Tool from this Desk haul and place it into your hand.</li>
<li>Discard any leftover Tools not exchanged.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Institution Grant Check (optional).</strong>
<p>Each Institution is looking for certain features. You may fill one grant slot per Preservation Window. For the Grant slot you wish to fill, place the Feature tokens required be its Institution   from your Ledger onto the matching Spotlight Demand Track, one space per token (If the track is full, put the tokens in the supply), then place one of your Research cubes on the left-most empty slot of that Institution.</p>
<p>Resolve that slot's point reward and perk.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Close the Preservation Window and continue play.</strong></li>
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>The Preservation Window ends immediately when any one of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A scholar Takes the Reading Desk (the Desk is now empty).</li>
<li>Every scholar Passes in turn, leaving the Desk untouched.</li>
<li>A scholar plays their Archive-Lockdown tile, halting further decisions and the Desk is left untouched.</li>
</ul>
<p>If at least one card remains in every scholar's hand, the bout winner now takes the Start-Player Quill and leads the next bout. If all hands are empty, the Collation Session ends‚Äîcarry out Majority Scoring (see ¬ß 4.7); after the last Majority Scoring, proceed to Final Scoring (see ¬ß 7).</p>
<h3>4.7 Majority Scoring</h3>
<p>The scholars compare their Evidence Ledgers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Feature that matches the <strong>Spotlight Color</strong> scores 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Place.
                <ul>
<li>1st: +7‚òÖ / 2nd: +4‚òÖ / 3rd: +1‚òÖ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Feature that matches the <strong>Lead color</strong> of the current Session's bout will score 1st and 2nd Place.
                <ul>
<li>1st: +5‚òÖ / 2nd: +3‚òÖ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All other features will score 1st place only.
                <ul>
<li>1st: +2‚òÖ</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep score on the Score Track.</p>
<h3>4.8 Prepare Next Bout</h3>
<ol>
<li>If every scholar's hand is empty, the Session ends‚Äîgo to Final Scoring (¬ß 7).</li>
<li>Otherwise the bout winner leads the next bout, repeating steps 4.1‚Äì4.7.</li>
</ol>
<div class="rule-note">
<p><strong>Orphan Bout (4-player only)</strong> ‚Äì After seven full two-card bouts, every scholar holds exactly one card. In that final bout skip the Echo step entirely; play only a Primary card, then resolve from step 4.2 onward.</p>

<h2>Institution Grants</h2>
<p>The five Institution Boards represent great research libraries that will underwrite your edition if you deliver the manuscript evidence they prize.</p>

<p>Each board shows:</p>
<table class="table">

<div class="rule-note">
<p><strong>Prestige symbol (‚òÖ)</strong> One ‚òÖ equals one Prestige Point.</p>
</div>
<h3>5.2 Fulfilling a Grant</h3>
<p>You may attempt one Grant immediately after you Take the Reading Desk:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pay Feature Tokens</strong> ‚Äì Place Feature tokens required by  the Institution onto their associated Demand Track one space per token.¬† ¬†¬†
<div><br/>

<h3>5.3 Edition Laureate Token</h3>
<p>The moment the fifteenth and final Grant slot across the five boards is filled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Award the Edition Laureate token to the scholar who placed that closing cube. It grants the scholar an instant bonus: flip one spent Preservation-Grant marker back to unused. Additionally, the Edition Laureate token is worth +4‚òÖ Prestige at Final Scoring.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- Page 7: End of Session -->
<div class="page-break"></div><div class="page">
<h2>End-of-Session Checklist</h2>
<p>A Collation Session ends the moment all scholars have emptied their hands and the final Preservation Window has been resolved.</p>
<h3>6.1 Tokenise any Witness cards still on the Reading Desk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Convert each remaining Witness card to its matching Feature, Lacuna, or Corruption token and leave those tokens on the Reading Desk.</li>
<li>Discard the physical cards (and any Tool cards still on the Desk) to the common discard so that the full 60-card deck can be reshuffled for the next deal.</li>
<li>These tokens remain in the Reading Desk and will be part of the very first Preservation Window of the next Collation Session. (If you just finished the final Session, they have no further effect.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>6.2 Discard unused Tools in Tableau</h3>
<h3>6.3 Check for End Game</h3>
<div class="setup-box">
<h4>Game-End Triggers</h4>
<p>The game can finish in one of three ways. Check these conditions after every bout and again after Majority Scoring.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hands = Players</strong>
<p>Once the table has completed a number of Collation Sessions equal to the number of scholars (e.g., four Sessions in a four-player game), proceed to Final Scoring (including that session's Majority Scoring).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Single-Grant Survivor</strong>
<p>At the end of any Session, if only one scholar still has any unused Preservation-Grant markers, complete Majority Scoring for that Session and then proceed to Final Scoring.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Grant Exhaustion Mid-Session</strong>
<p>If, during a Session, all Preservation-Grant markers are spent and there is no Tool card in play or on the Reading Desk that could refresh one, the Session ends immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip any remaining bouts.</li>
<li>Conduct Majority Scoring for this partial Session (use the tokens already in Evidence Ledgers).</li>
<li>Then proceed directly to Final Scoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If none of the above conditions occur, proceed to 6.4, Majority Scoring.</p>
<h3>6.4 Conduct Majority Scoring</h3>
<p>See section 4.7.</p>
<h3>6.5 Prepare for Additional Sessions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Collect all Witness and Tool cards, shuffle them into a fresh 60-card deck.</li>
<li>Flip every Archive-Lockdown tile face-up.</li>
<li>Do not refresh Preservation-Grant markers; they remain spent or unused as they stand.</li>
<li>Pass the Start-Player Quill clockwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>When ready, begin the next Collation Session with the normal deal (step 2.3).</p>
